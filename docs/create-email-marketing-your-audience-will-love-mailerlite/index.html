<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
<h4>✅ Pros (Why Choose MailerLite)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exceptional UI/UX:</strong> Widely considered one of the cleanest and easiest-to-navigate platforms on the market.</li>
<li><strong>Affordable Scaling:</strong> Provides premium features at a lower cost than many competitors, especially at the small and medium business level.</li>

</ul>
<h4>❌ Cons (Realistic Limitations)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Integrations:</strong> While it connects to major tools (Shopify, WordPress, etc.), its deepest CRM and highly custom API integrations might not be as extensive as massive enterprise platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Basic Reporting:</strong> Core analytics are strong, but reporting dashboards are less customizable than those found in complex marketing suites.</li>
<li><strong>Too Simple for Agencies:</strong> If you manage dozens of highly distinct brands and need extreme campaign complexity, you might outgrow MailerLite's core functionality eventually.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why choose this tool over other options?</h3>
<p>Many email marketing platforms force you to choose between simplicity and power. MailerLite bridges this gap. While some competitors offer dozens of unnecessary bells and whistles that bloat the interface, MailerLite focuses rigorously on what actually matters: easy email design, reliable delivery, and effective automation.</p>
