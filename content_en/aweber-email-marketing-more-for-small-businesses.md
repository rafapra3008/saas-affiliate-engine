### Pricing Overview

AWeber is designed to be accessible for those just starting out and scalable for growing businesses.

AWeber offers a generous **Free Plan** that includes access to most core features, landing pages, and essential automations, typically capped at a small subscriber limit. This allows new creators to test the platform and start building their list entirely for free.

Paid tiers are structured based on the size of your subscriber list and unlock advanced features like sophisticated behavioral targeting, unlimited list size, and priority support. The pricing scales predictably, ensuring the tool remains affordable as you grow.

### Pros and Cons

| Pros | Cons / Limitations |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Exceptional Deliverability:** Your emails are highly likely to reach the inbox. | **Interface Aesthetics:** While highly functional, the interface might feel less modern than some newer competitors. |
| **Industry-Leading Customer Support:** 24/7 access to knowledgeable human help. | **Automation Complexity:** Advanced, highly visual, multi-branching automations (like those required by large enterprises) can feel slightly less intuitive than in dedicated automation platforms. |
| **Ease of Use:** Simple setup, making it ideal for non-technical users. | **Limited E-commerce Focus:** Integrates well with e-commerce, but its native focus is primarily list growth and content delivery, not deep merchandising data. |
