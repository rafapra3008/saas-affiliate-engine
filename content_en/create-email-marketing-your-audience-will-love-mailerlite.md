### Pricing Overview

MailerLite is famous for its exceptional value, particularly for those just starting out or running smaller lists.

*   **Free Plan:** MailerLite offers a generous free tier, usually accommodating up to 1,000 subscribers and allowing you to send a high volume of monthly emails. This is a perfect way to test all the core features and build your initial list without financial commitment.
*   **Paid Plans:** As your list grows, the paid plans unlock crucial features like custom HTML editors, unlimited domains, premium 24/7 support, and sophisticated user-path automations. Pricing scales affordably based strictly on your subscriber count, ensuring you only pay for the list size you actually have.

### Pros and Cons

#### ✅ Pros (Why Choose MailerLite)
*   **Exceptional UI/UX:** Widely considered one of the cleanest and easiest-to-navigate platforms on the market.
*   **Affordable Scaling:** Provides premium features at a lower cost than many competitors, especially at the small and medium business level.
*   **High Deliverability:** Known for excellent infrastructure, helping ensure your emails consistently land in the inbox, not the spam folder.
*   **Robust Free Tier:** Allows beginners to build a legitimate email foundation before needing to pay.

#### ❌ Cons (Realistic Limitations)
*   **API Integrations:** While it connects to major tools (Shopify, WordPress, etc.), its deepest CRM and highly custom API integrations might not be as extensive as massive enterprise platforms.
*   **Basic Reporting:** Core analytics are strong, but reporting dashboards are less customizable than those found in complex marketing suites.
*   **Too Simple for Agencies:** If you manage dozens of highly distinct brands and need extreme campaign complexity, you might outgrow MailerLite's core functionality eventually.

### Why choose this tool over other options?

Many email marketing platforms force you to choose between simplicity and power. MailerLite bridges this gap. While some competitors offer dozens of unnecessary bells and whistles that bloat the interface, MailerLite focuses rigorously on what actually matters: easy email design, reliable delivery, and effective automation.

If you are currently wrestling with an overly complex legacy platform or feel limited by basic newsletter services, MailerLite provides a powerful upgrade without the accompanying steep learning curve or prohibitive expense. It allows small teams and individual creators to deploy sophisticated marketing funnels that typically require specialized developer support on other systems. It’s the practical choice for growing businesses focused on quick results and clean data.
