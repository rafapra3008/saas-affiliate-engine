### Pricing Overview

MailerLite is renowned for its commitment to providing a genuinely useful free starting point.

MailerLite offers one of the best Free plans available, which supports up to 1,000 subscribers and includes access to core features like automation workflows and basic segmentation. This means you can start building and monetizing your list immediately without financial commitment.

Paid plans are exceptionally affordable and scale smoothly. As your list grows and you need features like advanced deliverability, dedicated IP addresses, or unlimited emails, you move to competitively priced tiers that offer significant value compared to competitors focused on enterprise clients.

### Pros and Cons

#### ✅ Pros

*   **Intuitive Interface:** Widely praised as one of the easiest ESPs to learn and master.
*   **Excellent Free Tier:** Highly functional Free plan that includes automations and landing pages.
*   **High Deliverability Rates:** Reliable sending infrastructure ensures your emails actually land in the inbox.
*   **Built-in Landing Pages:** Reduce software stack complexity by creating simple web pages within the platform.

#### ❌ Cons

*   **Limited Deep Customization:** While highly functional, very advanced and complex conditional logic for automations might require higher tiers or specialized tools.
*   **Template Simplicity:** Design templates are clean and modern but might offer less visual variety than platforms focused purely on design (though this simplicity often aids conversion).

### Why choose this tool over other options?

Many new businesses face a choice: sacrifice features for a cheap, complex interface, or pay exorbitant prices for platforms built for Fortune 500 companies. MailerLite solves this by providing a professional, polished marketing tool built for the modern creator economy and small business owner.

You gain powerful automation, excellent list management, and high deliverability—all managed through an interface that respects your time.
